**Status:** production integration guidance  
**Basepoints:** `docs/audit-scope.md`, `docs/transaction-stack-audit.md`, `docs/remediation-status.md`, `SPEC.md`  
**Audience:** full-node, consensus, wallet, prover, and audit-tool implementers

This document turns the transaction-stack audit and supply-audit discussion into a full-node implementation plan. It is intentionally broader than proof verification: ghost-coin prevention depends on proof soundness, canonical consensus rules, supply accounting, state commitments, mempool policy, reorg handling, and independent auditability.

## Goals

- Make total supply publicly recomputable from genesis without decrypting shielded notes.
- Prevent ghost coins from invalid proofs, overflow, duplicate spends, malformed encodings, invalid issuance, or implementation divergence.
- Define which full-node controls are consensus-critical and which are optional operator/auditor enhancements.
- Provide default choices for production while recording viable alternatives.

## Current Repo Status

- The implemented transaction state machine uses the Plonky3 join-split proof path end to end: ownership, commitment opening, Merkle membership, nullifier derivation, value range, balance, output commitments, `mint`, and `tx_binding` are proven by `lattica-prover-p3` and checked through the Rust C ABI. This is not evidence of a live v2 network.
- The original C-01 ghost-coin output-commitment binding bug is remediated; see `docs/lattica-implementation-audit.md`.
- Round 2 verified live-node state-update atomicity, transmitted-note ownership, and admission size checks. Round 3 added reusable verifier-boundary size limits (M-08), and **compile-gated** the genesis/test issuance API (`bootstrapMint`) and the mock backend out of production builds (M-09/M-10, via `lattica_production`; see `src/production_probe.zig` / `zig build check-production`). Remaining blockers are host-chain consensus integration: canonical live transaction/block encoding, state-root / nullifier-set-root / event-root commitments, reorg undo logs, snapshot validation, and mempool proof-cache policy.
- The v3 HTLC layer adds `htlc_air` and `ShieldedHtlcTx`: HTLC note ownership, redeem/refund party tags, hashlock binding, timeout checks, hidden asset id, and mode-independent nullifier are proven in-circuit, while the node pins `current_height` to the consensus block height and derives `redeem_hashlock = SHA256(preimage)`.
- This document remains the full-node production checklist: `src/node.zig` is an in-memory shielded transaction state machine, not a complete production consensus node.
- The approved v2 block path is an additional prerequisite. The candidate now demonstrates root-only verification using the final proof, expected public statement, and pinned registry after inner-artifact deletion. The legacy monolith still requires inner proofs. Neither result establishes a reviewed production acceptance ABI, full-depth feasibility, complete-tree security, or host integration.

## HTLC Full-Node Requirements

The v3 HTLC transaction stack is only safe in production if the full node supplies the off-circuit context deterministically:

- `applyHtlc(tx, at_height)` must receive `at_height` from block consensus state, never from mempool or wallet input. Nodes should reject blocks whose HTLC transaction `current_height` does not equal the block height under the active consensus rules.
- Mempool policy must treat redeem and refund attempts for the same HTLC nullifier as conflicts. A block may include at most one; replay/reorg handling must restore the nullifier set and note roots exactly.
- Redeem preimages are public transaction data and should be indexed in a canonical event stream so cross-chain watchers can claim the opposite leg. The event root should commit preimage events, HTLC note commitments, and transaction ids.
- HTLC lock output 0 intentionally uses a placeholder ciphertext; wallets and watch services need a lock-descriptor/commitment index instead of relying only on note trial decryption.
- Timeout policy must define reorg cushions and cross-chain height/time conversion outside this package. Consensus should specify anchor windows and finality assumptions for accepting lock, redeem, and refund transactions.
- Replay from genesis must recompute identical supply, note-root, nullifier-root, and event-root outcomes without wallet secrets.

## Core Supply Invariant

Every fully validating node must maintain a supply state that can be recomputed from genesis:

```text
issued - burned = transparent_supply + shielded_pool_value + pending_or_paid_fees
```

For a shielded-only deployment, this simplifies to:

```text
issued - burned = shielded_pool_value + pending_or_paid_fees
```

The node must never learn individual shielded note values solely to audit supply. Instead, each accepted transaction must prove a correct public delta:

```text
sum(input_values) + public_deposit + minted
  = sum(output_values) + fee + public_withdrawal + burned
```

Private values stay private. The proof enforces the equation, and public counters track explicit issuance, burns, fees, deposits, and withdrawals.

## Block Production & Miner Incentives

Block production is host-chain (`rubble-node-zig`) scope; the agreed design is recorded in detail in
**`block-production-consensus.md`**. Summary:

- **Cadence:** a header-only **heartbeat block every 1.5 min** at uniform PoW difficulty, and a
  **transaction block every 12 min** — each 12-min cycle = 7 heartbeats + 1 transaction block.
  Heartbeats are ~240 B and carry no shielded-state delta (so shallow reorgs that land on them need no
  per-block undo data — see Reorg and Snapshot Safety); v2 transaction blocks target one recursive
  proof ≤2 MiB for ≤64 total transactions including issuance, with an ordered 64-leaf Merkle root.
  These are targets, not demonstrated capacity. Steady cadence keeps height a reliable proxy for time, which the height-denominated HTLC
  timeouts and the anchor window depend on.
- **Rewards:** heartbeats name a payout address in the PoW-committed header but mint no in-block note;
  subsidies settle lazily in the next transaction block's coinbase via the gated `applyCoinbase` under
  the supply invariant above.
- **Fees:** a transaction block's fees + accrued subsidies are split **deterministically, weighted toward
  the transaction-block producer**, remainder equally among the cycle's 7 heartbeat miners — a function
  of the block + the committed heartbeat headers (anti-fee-sniping). Realized via a multi-payee coinbase
  (8 payees ⇒ 4 issuance transactions / 8 output notes at `M_OUT = 2`). Typed recursive issuance
  leaves and host checks of authorized totals/payees are required before activation; do not substitute
  coinbase tiles in a direct witness batch. Issuance transactions count toward the 64-transaction cap.
- **Payout addresses:** the shared-KEM exchange-deposit scheme (O(1) detection) for pools/exchanges.
- **Capacity target:** ~320 total tx/hr (64 / 12 min), including issuance; not a benchmark.
  [Block-proving v2](block-proving-v2.md) requires bounded hash/FRI recursion, new versioned root/profile
  handling, and 48 GiB RAM / 12 GiB VRAM / 128 GiB scratch gates. Curve/SNARK wraps are excluded.

## Consensus-Critical Full Node Pipeline

### Proposed distributed proving boundary

The [distributed proving roadmap](distributed-proving.md) adds a proposed service
boundary, not a new consensus acceptance path. A host must derive the expected
ordered root from its canonical block body and approved profile, verify the final
proof and perform the state checks below. Worker identity, completion receipts,
telemetry and coordinator assertions cannot replace those checks. Selection,
sealing, HTLC height, conflicts and reorg eligibility remain host responsibilities.
Neither remote execution nor worker payments change capacity/cadence or activate
a new proof family. Historical verification must remain independent of the
worker network and off-chain inner-artifact retention.

### 1. Decode and Canonicalize

Reject before expensive checks if any consensus object fails canonical parsing.

- Version and network id must match the active consensus rules.
- Integers must use a single canonical width and endian convention.
- Field elements must be `< P`; no alternate encodings.
- Proofs, signatures, public keys, commitments, and ciphertexts must have exact lengths.
- Trailing bytes are rejected everywhere.
- Transaction ids are computed from canonical bytes only.

**Default:** canonical binary encoding with explicit version byte and domain-separated transaction digest.  
**Option:** use a schema language for tooling, but consensus should verify exact byte layout rather than trusting schema libraries.

### 2. Validate Transaction Context

For each transaction, verify cheap context before proof work.

- Chain id, epoch, feature flags, and tx version are accepted.
- Fee policy and minimum relay fee are met.
- Inputs, outputs, proof count, and byte size are within limits.
- Join-split proof is bound to the canonical `tx_binding` digest; any future host-chain signature
  layer verifies under a separate domain.
- Public mint/deposit/withdraw/burn fields are well formed and permitted by transaction type.

**Default:** one canonical tx digest (`tx_binding`) bound into every join-split proof; any host-chain
signature or authorization layer must use a separate domain if added later.
**Option:** separate digest domains for consensus validation, wallet authorization, and mempool policy to avoid cross-use.

### 3. Verify Shielded Spend Proofs

The production spend proof must prove all private spend facts in one statement:

- note commitment opening matches the committed leaf;
- note is a member of the public anchor tree;
- nullifier is correctly derived from note secrets and position;
- spend authority is bound to the note owner;
- input and output values are in range;
- balance equation holds with no field wraparound;
- output commitments encrypt/commit to the same values used in balance;
- transaction digest is bound into the proof.

**Default:** vetted transparent FRI-STARK with extension-field challenges. The frozen v1 accounting is
approximately 103 bits proven / 127 conjectured; the separate v2 target is at least 100 bits proven
for the complete maximum-size tree under documented assumptions, not merely for each constituent proof.
**Option:** keep the Zig reference STARK as a differential-test oracle only; it should not be the production verifier.

For the **inactive v2 target**, wallet proofs are verified at off-chain admission and recursively
aggregated; blocks retain only the final proof, public transaction data, and encrypted outputs.
Block validation must recompute the ordered root and verify the final proof against the registered
profile without inner proofs, a prover cache, or private witnesses. All state-dependent checks below
remain necessary. Legacy verification rules remain available for historical replay only as governed
by host activation rules, not as an automatic downgrade for rejected v2 blocks.

### 4. Enforce Nullifier and Anchor Rules

For each block and transaction:

- every anchor must be a known historical note commitment root within the permitted anchor window;
- every nullifier must be unseen in the chain state;
- every nullifier must be unique within the transaction and block;
- nullifier insertion happens only after all transaction checks pass.

**Default:** consensus state includes a cryptographic nullifier-set root committed in every block header.  
**Option:** use an append-only nullifier Merkle tree, sparse Merkle tree, or authenticated key-value accumulator; choose one and make it part of consensus.

### 5. Update Supply State With Checked Arithmetic

All supply counters use checked arithmetic and reject overflow.

Required counters:

```text
issued
burned
shielded_pool_delta
transparent_delta
fees_pending
fees_paid
```

Each transaction returns a deterministic `SupplyDelta`:

```text
SupplyDelta {
  issued,
  burned,
  shielded_pool_delta,
  transparent_delta,
  fee,
}
```

For ordinary shielded transfers, `shielded_pool_delta = 0` except fees if fees leave the pool. For mints, burns, bridge deposits, or withdrawals, the corresponding public event must explain the delta.

**Default:** full nodes recompute supply counters from genesis and reject any block whose declared counters do not match.  
**Option:** store per-block supply deltas for fast indexer queries, but treat them as derived data unless committed by consensus.

### 6. Recompute State Commitments

After applying a block, the node recomputes all roots and compares them to the block header.

Required commitments:

```text
BlockCommitments {
  tx_root,
  note_root,
  nullifier_root,
  supply_root,
  event_root,
}
```

Recommended additional commitments:

```text
proof_root,
fee_root,
withdrawal_root,
consensus_params_hash
```

**Default:** block headers commit to all consensus state roots needed for independent replay and light-client verification.  
**Option:** keep some roots out of the header for PoC simplicity, but production should not rely on uncommitted node-local state.

## Security Option Matrix

| Area | Recommended default | Alternative | Security note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Supply model | Shielded-only with explicit mint/burn events | Mixed transparent/shielded turnstile | Turnstiles improve auditability but add bridge accounting risk. |
| Supply audit | Public recomputation from genesis | Trusted auditor reports | Consensus must not depend on trusted reports. |
| Proof system | Vetted transparent FRI-STARK with extension-field challenges | Local/reference STARK | Reference STARK is useful for testing, not production. |
| Hash in circuit | Published Poseidon2/Rescue-Prime parameters | Locally generated constants | Local constants need separate cryptanalysis. |
| Value privacy | Values hidden; balance/range proven | Values public to validators | Public values simplify audit but weaken privacy. |
| View/audit keys | Optional, non-consensus | Mandatory regulated disclosure | Useful for compliance; not a substitute for proof soundness. |
| Nullifier set | Header-committed authenticated set | Node-local hash set | Node-local only is not enough for snapshots/light clients. |
| Snapshots | Root-verified plus checkpointed | Operator-trusted snapshot | Trusted snapshots can hide ghost coins. |
| Mempool | Preverify and cache by canonical tx hash | Verify only at block time | Preverify reduces DoS and invalid block risk. |
| Metrics | Invariant drift alerts and proof failure counters | Logs only | Metrics are operational controls, not consensus. |

## Full Node Interfaces

These are implementation targets, not current Zig APIs.

V2 additionally targets versioned public-only leaf wrapping, pairwise merging, standalone root
verification, and a submit/status/seal/cancel coordinator. Wallet witness APIs must remain separate.
No byte schema, feature activation, or new host-network API is established by this document.

```zig
const SupplyState = struct {
    issued: u128,
    burned: u128,
    shielded_pool: u128,
    transparent: u128,
    fees_pending: u128,
    fees_paid: u128,
};

const SupplyDelta = struct {
    issued: i128,
    burned: i128,
    shielded_pool: i128,
    transparent: i128,
    fee: u128,
};

const BlockCommitments = struct {
    tx_root: Hash32,
    note_root: Hash32,
    nullifier_root: Hash32,
    supply_root: Hash32,
    event_root: Hash32,
};

const NodeSecurityPolicy = struct {
    proof_policy: ProofPolicy,
    audit_mode: AuditMode,
    mempool_limits: MempoolLimits,
    snapshot_policy: SnapshotPolicy,
};

const VerificationReport = struct {
    txid: Hash32,
    accepted: bool,
    reason: RejectReason,
    supply_delta: SupplyDelta,
    proof_time_ms: u64,
};
```

Implementation requirements:

- reports are deterministic and safe to expose to indexers;
- rejection reasons do not leak private witness values;
- supply deltas are public and root-committed;
- signed/serialized reports are optional operator tooling, not consensus inputs.

## Mempool Security

The mempool should protect full nodes from proof-verification DoS and consensus divergence.

Required policy:

- canonical decode before admission;
- reject duplicate nullifiers already in chain or mempool;
- reject transactions whose anchor is unknown or too old;
- enforce max proof bytes, max actions, and max ciphertext bytes;
- verify signatures before proofs;
- cache proof verification by canonical transaction hash and consensus parameter hash;
- evict cached results when consensus parameters change.

For v2, individual proofs and completed subtrees are temporary off-chain artifacts, not ledger data.
Bound their queues, cache, and worker resources; bind cached verification to canonical statements,
profiles/proof identities, and relevant execution context. Seal an immutable ordered selection so
new arrivals do not restart its proof; defer late work. Recheck anchors, conflicts, issuance, and HTLC
height at sealing and application. Reorgs invalidate eligibility even when proof verification remains
cached. Validate artifacts on restart and prune after a bounded recovery window; historical root
verification must succeed after pruning. Deadlines, resource failures, and cancellation must fail
explicitly without switching to witness batches, proof containers, or weakened parameters.

Recommended options:

- **Strict mode:** preverify every proof before relay. Best for security, more CPU.
- **Hybrid mode:** perform cheap checks and queue proof verification before mining/block inclusion. Better throughput, more mempool complexity.
- **Block-only mode:** not recommended for production because it relays invalid expensive transactions too easily.

## Reorg and Snapshot Safety

A production full node must be able to disconnect and reconnect blocks without corrupting audit state.

Per-block undo data:

- inserted note commitments and previous note root;
- inserted nullifiers and previous nullifier root;
- supply delta and previous supply state;
- fee accounting changes;
- event root changes;
- anchor-window changes.

Snapshot acceptance rules:

- snapshot declares block height, block hash, and all consensus state roots;
- node verifies snapshot roots against a trusted checkpoint or replays from genesis;
- supply counters are included in the state root;
- nullifier set and note tree roots are independently checked;
- snapshots do not bypass canonical serialization or proof rules for future blocks.

**Default:** snapshots are performance tools only; genesis replay remains the canonical audit path.

## Observability and Audit Exports

Full nodes should expose enough public data for independent auditors to detect supply issues.

Required audit exports:

- per-block supply delta;
- cumulative supply state;
- note root and nullifier root;
- issuance, burn, deposit, withdrawal, and fee events;
- proof-verification aggregate counts;
- rejected block and transaction reason codes.

Recommended alerts:

- supply invariant drift;
- block header root mismatch;
- duplicate nullifier attempt;
- unexpected issuance event;
- proof failure spike;
- anchor-window failure spike;
- snapshot root mismatch;
- verifier implementation disagreement.
- v2 aggregation queue/deadline overruns, resource-admission failures, scratch/cache exhaustion,
  restart recovery failures, and final proof-size violations (instrumentation targets, not live metrics).

Optional non-consensus tooling:

- threshold view-key audit for regulated deployments;
- auditor-run indexers;
- independent Rust/Zig verifier cross-check service;
- periodic signed audit statements over public counters.

## Implementation Phases

The host phases below are separate from the Lattica v2 milestones in
[block-proving-v2.md](block-proving-v2.md). Lattica delivers libraries, the coordinator, block-apply
interface, and a simulated-host harness/handoff; actual network, persistence, consensus, reorg,
emission, and activation work belongs to the host. Neither phase list records a completed v2 rollout.

### P1: Protocol Finalization

- Finalize transaction and block formats.
- Decide shielded-only versus mixed transparent/shielded supply model.
- Specify canonical encodings, digest domains, state roots, and supply counters.
- Define public event types for mint, burn, deposit, withdrawal, and fees.

### P2: Production Spend Proof

- Move to vetted FRI-STARK framework with production soundness parameters.
- Implement full spend statement: ownership, commitment opening, membership, nullifier, range, balance, and tx binding.
- Replace local Rescue parameters with published in-circuit hash parameters.
- Add canonical proof serialization and verifier APIs.

### P3: Full Node State Engine

- Implement authenticated note tree and nullifier set roots.
- Add `SupplyState`, `SupplyDelta`, and block commitment verification.
- Implement reorg-safe undo logs and snapshot validation.
- Make all arithmetic checked and all consensus state updates atomic.

### P4: Mempool and Networking

- Add mempool preverification, nullifier conflict checks, fee policy, and proof cache.
- Rate-limit proof verification and large transaction relay.
- Ensure mempool policy cannot weaken consensus validation.

### P5: Audit and Testnet

- Run independent verifier/indexer cross-checks.
- Replay from genesis and compare supply roots across implementations.
- Complete cryptographic audit of the proof statement and framework integration.
- Launch testnet with invariant monitoring and incident response runbooks.

## Test Plan

Consensus tests:

- valid shielded transfer preserves supply;
- forged balance proof rejected;
- value range overflow rejected;
- duplicate nullifier rejected within tx, block, mempool, and chain;
- unknown/stale anchor rejected;
- malformed canonical encoding rejected;
- wrong tx-binding digest rejected;
- wrong public supply delta rejected;
- block header state-root mismatch rejected.

Supply tests:

- genesis replay reproduces final supply state;
- mint increases `issued` and shielded pool exactly once;
- burn decreases shielded pool and increases `burned`;
- fee moves from shielded value to fee accounting without changing total supply;
- deposit/withdrawal events match public event roots;
- all counters reject overflow and underflow.

Operational tests:

- reorg disconnect/reconnect restores note root, nullifier root, and supply state;
- snapshot import verifies all roots and counters;
- proof cache invalidates across consensus parameter changes;
- independent verifier agrees on accepted/rejected blocks;
- metrics fire on duplicate nullifier, proof failure spike, and supply drift.

## Production Release Gates

Do not enable value-bearing production use until:

1. full spend proof is live in node validation;
2. production proof framework and in-circuit hash parameters are selected and audited;
3. public supply counters and state roots are committed by block headers;
4. all value arithmetic uses checked wide counters;
5. canonical serialization is enforced across every consensus object;
6. nullifier set and note tree are authenticated and snapshot-safe;
7. at least two independent implementations or verifier paths replay the same chain to the same roots;
8. monitoring and incident response procedures exist for invariant drift and verifier disagreement.
9. for v2 activation, bounded full-strength recursion, complete-tree soundness, root-only verification,
   full join-split/HTLC/issuance coverage, resource/latency gates, and dedicated cryptographic review
   are evidenced; versioned encodings and activation are explicit, with no excluded fallback paths.

## Non-Goals

- This document does not define a final block format.
- It does not select a final FRI-STARK framework.
- It does not make view keys mandatory.
- It does not replace a cryptographic audit of the production spend proof.
