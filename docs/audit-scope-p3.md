# Lattica spend circuit — external audit scope, threat model & readiness (Plonky3 stack)

> **Document role:** Current technical scope and threat model for the Plonky3 production surface. Read with [`AUDITORS.md`](AUDITORS.md).

Auditor handoff for the **production** proving stack (`lattica-prover-p3/`). It defines what is in
scope, the trust/threat model, the frozen parameters, known limitations, and the pre-audit readiness
checklist. Companion docs: `docs/soundness-budget.md` (C-04), `docs/plonky3-port-plan.md` (how the
circuit was built), `docs/remediation-status.md` (audit-finding tracker), `docs/audit-readiness-status.md`
(current post-`v3-audit` state + the remaining audit-prep roadmap), `docs/audit-scope.md` (the
older *Winterfell* reviewer guide — reference only; superseded by this for production).

> **Status: ready for external review; one deliberate-parameter sign-off remains (not a bug).** The
> production circuit is the **join-split N-in/M-out** (`joinsplit_air`, §6), with the soundness fixes
> applied (A1–A4, 128-bit `nk`, **128-bit `rho`/`rcm`**) and the live protocol fully cut over to it:
> Poseidon2 on-chain hashing == circuit; hidden-value node tx model; fail-closed, panic-isolated
> verifier; validated coinbase issuance (`mint` is impossible except via the consensus-authorized
> path). Four adversarial recheck passes hardened it: they found + fixed real bugs — the ZK-blinding
> RNG, a node-layer `mint` inflation hole, and (after the `rho`/`rcm` widening) a missing `rho1`
> persistence constraint that would have allowed a forged second nullifier per note — plus added
> verifier panic isolation.
>
> **The in-node real prove→verify path executes green** (`scripts/run-real-integration.sh`:
> the Zig node builds the witness → real Rust prover → Zig reconstructs the public inputs → real Rust
> verifier → accept; replay + tamper rejected). It is built as an object linked with the system
> toolchain because this host's Zig linker can't link the Rust staticlib.

> (`rubble-node-zig`); lattica provides the shielded-tx + issuance *mechanisms* it drives.

## 1. Scope

**In scope (to be audited):**
- The circuit: `lattica-prover-p3/src/{joinsplit_air,htlc_air,poseidon2_air}.rs` — the AIR
  constraints, trace generation, periodic columns, and the cross-region binding (`joinsplit_air` is
  the production circuits; `poseidon2_air` is their Poseidon2 permutation building block).
- The verifier/prover boundary: `lattica-prover-p3/src/lib.rs` — `lattica_joinsplit_verify` /
  `lattica_joinsplit_prove` C ABI, the `JoinSplitPublicInputs` + witness parsing, canonical
  field-element checks, fail-closed + panic-isolated behavior, proof (de)serialization.
- The Zig protocol seam: `src/ffi.zig` (ABI shape), `src/protocol.zig` (tx encoding, supply model,
  tx-binding digest), `src/codec.zig` (canonical encoding) — **specifically the requirement that the
  on-chain hashes equal the in-circuit hashes** (see §5 / C-03).
- **Batch aggregation (one proof per block)** — `lattica-prover-p3/src/{batch_joinsplit_air,batch_htlc_air}.rs`
  + the C ABI (`lattica_batch_*` / `lattica_htlc_batch_*` in `lib.rs`) + the Zig seam/apply path
  (`node.batchRoot`/`htlcBatchRoot`, `Chain.applyBatch`/`applyHtlcBatch`, `ffi.verifyBatch`/`proveBatch`).
  Reviewer guide — the batch reuses each tile's audited per-tx constraints (proven byte-frozen via the
  unchanged corrupted-trace suites) and adds only: (1) **tile self-containment** (the `P_TILE_LAST`
  one-hot frees per-tile-persistent columns + ASSET at the boundary; each tile must independently
  balance via the tile-periodic `P_ROW0`/`P_FINAL`); (2) **per-tile staging columns** bound to the
  computed statement, redirecting the per-tx public-input bindings; (3) the **in-circuit tx-root fold**
  (`DOM_TXROOT` MD-chain over each tile's statement → one running root → the single block-tx-root public
  input) with **dummy-tile padding** to a power of two; (4) node-side, the **intra-batch double-spend
  check** (a nullifier may not repeat across the batch) + the proven-soundness floor
  `MAX_BATCH_TILES = 64`. Key property to confirm: the single tx-root public input binds exactly the set
  of per-tx statements the node applies — no tile can borrow value/keys/asset from another, and a dummy
  tile cannot stand in for a real tx. See `docs/soundness-budget.md` (batch section) for the floor.
- The frozen parameter set and proof format (§4).

**Implemented since this doc was first written (status update for the auditor):**
- **Batch aggregation is now production + validated** (no longer a prototype): `batch_joinsplit_air` /
  `batch_htlc_air` (one proof per block, bound to a single tx-root public input) + the node
  `applyBatch` / `applyHtlcBatch` path. Real-prover-validated end-to-end; proven-soundness floor
  `MAX_BATCH_TILES = 64` (see `docs/soundness-budget.md`). **Now formally in scope** — see the batch
  entry + reviewer guide in the In-scope list above.

**Out of scope (this round):**
- **Recursion (`lattica-prover-p3/src/recursion/`) — RESEARCH, NOT PRODUCTION, NOT audited, out of this
  round.** The in-circuit recursive verifier ("the monolith", `MonolithAir`) **is built + validated
  (R1–R5)** — one AIR that accepts iff `p3::verify(inner)` accepts (a real `JoinSplitAir` inner, non-hiding
  and hiding), plus an aggregator whose block tx-root is byte-identical to `batch_joinsplit_air::batch_root`.
  It is feature-gated (`--features recursion`; zero recursion symbols in the default staticlib), on no
  production path, and the deep self-recursion tree is deferred behind a wrap. Do **not** audit as
  production; the consolidated status + review/improvement surface is
  `docs/recursion-aggregation-status.md` (with `docs/recursion-design.md` §10,
  `docs/recursion-verifier-audit.md`, and `docs/recursion-aggregation-params.md`).
- **GPU + streaming provers (`src/gpu*.rs`, `src/quotient_gpu.rs`, `src/stream_prove.rs`,
  `src/spill_alloc.rs`) — RESEARCH, NOT PRODUCTION, out of this round.** Opt-in accelerators
  (`--features gpu` / `stream`), **prove-only + byte-compatible**: a GPU or streamed proof deserializes
  and verifies under the standard production verifier unchanged, and neither is in the default staticlib
  (`lattica-prover-p3/scripts/check-abi-symbols.sh`) or the C-ABI. Not audited. See
  `docs/gpu-acceleration.md` and `docs/audit-readiness-status.md`.
- The live consensus node (`rubble-node-zig`) beyond the verify seam; networking; mempool; P2P; the
  heartbeat block-production design (`docs/block-production-consensus.md`, host-chain scope).
- The wallet/prover key management and note-discovery.
- Performance (covered by `docs/soundness-budget.md`; not a security gate).

**Reference only (not audited as production):** the Winterfell `lattica-prover/` crate — kept as a
differential oracle for the hashes, not a production artifact.

## 2. Trust model & assumptions

- **Roles.** The **prover** (wallet) is fully untrusted. The **verifier** (node, via
  `lattica_joinsplit_verify` / `lattica_htlc_verify`) is the security boundary. A spend proof is a
  *validity witness*; the node enforces the stateful checks the proof does not (nullifier-set
  non-membership = double-spend prevention; anchor is a known tree root; fee policy).
- **Cryptographic assumptions.**
  - **Poseidon2-Goldilocks** (vetted `p3-goldilocks` constants) modeled as collision-resistant /
    random-oracle-like. *A dedicated Poseidon2 parameter & algebraic-attack review is explicitly
    requested as part of this audit.*
  - **FRI / STARK soundness** per ethSTARK (2021/582) and the proven bounds (2024/1553, 2025/2055);
    Fiat–Shamir in the ROM. Soundness level **≈103-bit proven / ~127-bit conjectured**, machine-
    checked (`docs/soundness-budget.md`, `production_security_budget` test).
  - **Transparency:** no trusted setup. **Post-quantum:** no elliptic curves / pairings. Stable Rust.
  - **ML-KEM (note encryption).** IND-CCA for note secrecy. **Exchange mode additionally assumes ML-KEM
    ciphertext anonymity / key-privacy (IK-CCA)** — that a `kem_ct` is unlinkable to its `ek` — for
    cross-deposit unlinkability when many deposit addresses share one KEM key (Grubbs–Maram–Paterson,
    EUROCRYPT 2022). Wallet mode does **not** rely on this (distinct keys ⇒ unconditional). No forward
    secrecy: on-chain `kem_ct`s are permanent, so a shared-key compromise opens that epoch's deposit
    history — deanonymization only (`nk` stays cold). This is **wallet-layer, not consensus**: both modes
    use the same `recipient = H(nk‖div)`, commitment, nullifier, and circuit, so consensus soundness is
    unaffected by the choice of address mode.
- **What the join-split proof guarantees:** for each of `N=2` inputs there exist hidden note
  openings `(nk, div, asset, value, rho, rcm, path)` whose commitments are members under the public
  `anchor`, whose public nullifiers bind the note position, and whose notes all share the hidden
  asset id. For each of `M=2` outputs, the proof binds the public output commitment. It enforces
  `Σ input_value + mint = Σ output_value + fee`, value/range bounds `< 2^BITS`, and the public
  `tx_binding`.
- **What the HTLC proof adds:** `note_type` distinguishes PLAIN vs HTLC notes, HTLC notes commit
  `owner = htlc_root(redeem_tag, refund_tag, hashlock, timeout)`, redeem/refund party tags are
  mode-selected, redeem binds the note hashlock to public `redeem_hashlock`, timeout comparison uses
  public `current_height`, `mint` is forced to zero, and the HTLC nullifier is owner-based and
  mode-independent.
- **What the proof does NOT guarantee (node's responsibility):** `nf` not already spent; `anchor` is
  a valid historical root; `fee` matches policy; transaction-level authorization/signatures outside
  the shielded statement.

## 3. The statement under audit (current artifact)

The production artifact is `joinsplit_air` (`N_IN=2`, `M_OUT=2`) plus the v3 `htlc_air`
extension. Both use Poseidon2-Goldilocks, depth-32 membership paths, hiding (ZK) FRI PCS, and the
same transaction binding model.

Join-split public inputs are 26 Goldilocks field elements:
`anchor(4) ‖ nf_0(4) ‖ nf_1(4) ‖ out_cm_0(4) ‖ out_cm_1(4) ‖ fee(1) ‖ mint(1) ‖ tx_binding(4)`.
HTLC public inputs append `current_height(1) ‖ redeem_hashlock(4)` for 31 field elements.

| Region | Join-split constraint | HTLC delta |
|---|---|---|
| ownership | `recipient = H(DOM_OWN, nk0, nk1, div)` | PLAIN uses recipient; HTLC uses `htlc_root` owner |
| commitment | two-permutation note commitment binds owner, value, rho, rcm, hidden `asset`, `note_type` | `note_type` boolean selects PLAIN/HTLC |
| membership | each input commitment folds up a general-position depth-`DEPTH` path to public `anchor` | unchanged |
| nullifier | PLAIN `nf = H(DOM_NF, nk, rho, pos)` | HTLC `nf = H(DOM_NF_HTLC, owner, rho, pos)` mode/party-independent |
| outputs | output commitments are public inputs and the single source for node tree insertion | output asset matches hidden transaction asset |
| balance/range | `Σin + mint = Σout + fee`, values/fee/mint range-checked `< 2^BITS` | HTLC forces `mint = 0`; also range-checks `current_height`/timeout slack |
| HTLC access | not applicable | mode-selected party tag, redeem hashlock binding, timeout comparison |
| tx-binding | public `tx_binding` bound by Fiat-Shamir | additionally binds `current_height`, reduced hashlock, and raw redeem preimage in node body |

Cross-region binding uses **persistent columns** (`nk, rho, value, out_value`, constant across the
trace, pinned per block) and **period-256 one-hot boundary selectors**; within-block Poseidon2 rounds
use the period-32 round schedule. Hash inputs use the **vetted** Poseidon2-Goldilocks constants, so
the in-circuit hash equals the protocol's native `Poseidon2Goldilocks` (differential-tested).

## 4. Frozen parameters & proof format

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Base field | Goldilocks `p = 2^64 − 2^32 + 1` |
| Challenge field | `F_p²` (BinomialExtensionField, degree 2) |
| Hash | Poseidon2, width 8, S-box `x^7`, 8 full + 22 partial rounds, vetted `GOLDILOCKS_POSEIDON2_RC_8_*` |
| Merkle/leaf hash | Poseidon2 sponge/compression, 4-Goldilocks digest |
| FRI | `log_blowup=4`, `num_queries=96`, `query_pow=16`, `commit_pow=0`, `max_log_arity=4`, `cap_height=6` |
| Soundness | ≈103-bit proven / ~127-bit conjectured |
| Circuit params | `DEPTH=32`, `BITS=52`, `recipient`=4-element digest |
| Proof serialization | postcard; `JoinSplitPublicInputs` = `anchor ‖ N·nf ‖ M·out_cm ‖ tx_binding ‖ fee(8 LE) ‖ mint(8 LE)` = 208 bytes; `HtlcPublicInputs` = that ‖ `current_height(8 LE)` ‖ `redeem_hashlock(32)` = 248 bytes (`lib.rs` `encode_{joinsplit,htlc}_public_inputs`) |
| Proof size / verify | ~421 KB / ~8 ms join-split; ~469 KB HTLC (`DEPTH=32`) |

These freeze for the audited artifact. The live circuit is the **join-split** (`N=2` inputs, `M=2`
outputs); the **v3 HTLC** circuit (`htlc_air`) is the same shape plus the HTLC columns/public inputs
(see `docs/htlc-constraint-audit.md`). The pre-Plonky3 one-input spend path has been removed.

## 5. Known limitations & open items (must close before audit)

Tracked in detail in `docs/remediation-status.md`. The soundness-relevant ones:

- **A1 — position-consistency. ✅ Closed** in the join-split circuit (`joinsplit_air`): `pos = Σ_d
  bits_d·2^d` is accumulated from the membership path (a `pos_acc` column updated at each link with a
  `2^d` coefficient) and bound into the nullifier input, so a note has exactly one nullifier tied to
  its tree position. Validated natively (distinct positions ⇒ distinct nullifiers) and in-circuit
  (the `pos_acc`→nullifier binding).
- **A2 — domain separation. ✅ Closed**: ownership/commitment/nullifier carry distinct lane-0 tags
  `DOM_OWN/DOM_CM/DOM_NF`; the Merkle merge is untagged but structurally separated (only ever a
  2-to-1 over digests; the tree leaf is a `DOM_CM`-tagged commitment). See the A4 argument below.
  Validated (same field input, different domain ⇒ different digest).
- **A3 — fee soundness. ✅ Closed**: every input value, output value, **and the fee** are
  range-checked (`< 2^BITS`, running-remainder) and the value balance is a global accumulator
  `Σin − Σout − fee = 0`; all addends bounded ⇒ no field wraparound. Validated (out-of-range and
  wrong-fee rejected).
- **A4 — nullifier-derivation argument. ✅ Written** (see "A4 — nullifier-derivation" below).
- **C-03 — protocol/circuit hash match. 🟡 Hash matched; protocol swap = M6.** `src/poseidon2.zig`
  is a Zig Poseidon2-Goldilocks that reproduces the circuit's permutation **and** the domain-tagged
  `recipient`/`commit`/`nullifier`/`merge` hashes **byte-for-byte** — pinned by known-answer vectors
  generated from the circuit (`dump_p2`) and asserted in `poseidon2.zig`'s KAT tests. The remaining
  step is the **coordinated protocol swap**: migrate the `Note` model (`tx.zig`) + Merkle tree
  (`tree.zig`) off SHA3 onto these functions (note fields become Goldilocks elements). Because that
  swap is protocol-wide (touches note encryption/wallet) it lands with the **M6 node cutover**; the
  end-to-end FFI test (below) demonstrates the protocol-side `poseidon2.zig` hashes equal the
  circuit's via a real proof verifying.
- Single-asset; no memo field. **Mint / coinbase issuance ARE modeled** (see the §7 checklist —
  `Σin + mint = Σout + fee`, range-checked; `Chain.applyCoinbase` requires `mint == 0` on the normal
  path); the single-hidden-asset substrate is the deliberate v1 scope (`docs/protocol-v1-decisions.md`).

### A4 — nullifier-derivation argument
The nullifier is `nf = H(DOM_NF ‖ nk ‖ rho ‖ pos)` with `H` = Poseidon2-Goldilocks (vetted constants),
modeled as a random oracle. Properties:
- **Uniqueness / no double-spend.** `pos` is bound (A1) to the note's tree position and `rho` is the
  note's per-note randomness; together with `nk` they fix a single `nf` per (note, position). A note
  occupies one position, so it has exactly one nullifier — re-spending yields the same `nf`, caught by
  the node's nullifier set.
- **Binding / unforgeability.** Computing `nf` requires `nk` (the nullifier key, never revealed) and
  the note opening; in the ROM, `nf` reveals nothing about `nk`/`rho` and cannot be produced without
  them. Ownership binds `recipient = H(DOM_OWN ‖ nk)` into the spent commitment, so the same `nk`
  that authorizes the spend derives the nullifier (no nullifier/authority split).
- **No faerie-gold / cross-context collision.** Domain separation (A2) prevents an `nf` from
  coinciding with a commitment, ownership digest, or Merkle node. `rho` must be unique per note
  (a protocol-level invariant on note creation — flagged for the auditor as an assumption); given
  that, `H`'s collision resistance gives distinct `nf` for distinct notes.
- **Residual to audit:** the untagged merge (collision between a merge node and a data hash would
  require a Poseidon2 preimage/collision — out of scope of the statement, in scope of the requested
  Poseidon2 review), and the `rho`-uniqueness invariant on the note-creation side.

## 6. Join-split (N-in / M-out) — **landed** *(decision 2026-06-26; built)*

`joinsplit_air` implements the audit-target N-in/M-out shape. The v3 `htlc_air` circuit extends the
same transaction substrate with HTLC owner, mode, hashlock, timeout, and owner-nullifier constraints:
- **N input notes** (`N_IN`), each: ownership `recipient = H(DOM_OWN ‖ nk)`, commitment
  `cm = H(DOM_CM ‖ recipient ‖ value ‖ rho ‖ rcm)`, general-position membership to a **shared public
  `anchor`**, and a revealed nullifier `nf_i = H(DOM_NF ‖ nk ‖ rho ‖ pos)` (A1).
- **M output notes** (`M_OUT`), each a published `out_cm_j` binding `out_value_j`.
- **Value balance:** a global accumulator `Σ in − Σ out − fee = 0`, with every value + the fee
  range-checked `< 2^BITS` (A3) ⇒ no wraparound.
- **One `tx_binding`** bound by Fiat–Shamir.
- Cross-region binding via local-persistent columns (`nk`/`rho`/`value`, constant within an input
  span, freed at region boundaries).

**Parameters & numbers (current):** `N_IN=2, M_OUT=2, DEPTH=32, BITS=52`; production FRI params;
proof ~**444 KB**, prove ~**8.3 s**, verify ~**24 ms**, **proven 103-bit**. Validated 12/12
(valid; wrong anchor / nullifier / out_cm / fee; out-of-range; wrong tx_binding; native
domain-separation / pos-from-bits / balance).

**Design choices made:** fixed `(N, M)` as compile-time constants (2,2 now); per-instance public
inputs `anchor ‖ N·nf ‖ M·out_cm ‖ fee ‖ tx_binding` with per-input/output one-hot bindings (not an
aggregate hash — that is the future batching path); per-input distinct `nk`/`rho` via the
local-persistent columns.

**Variable `(N, M)`** is supported by the standard **dummy-note convention**: a smaller transaction
pads to the fixed 2-in/2-out shape with zero-value notes (a dummy input is a zero-value note the
spender owns; balance and range are unaffected). Tested (`dummy_notes_pad_smaller_transactions`). A
variable-shape circuit is only needed if more than 2-in/2-out is required.

**Remaining for the audited artifact:** none — the **C-03 protocol note-model swap** (migrate the
`Note` model + Merkle tree off SHA3 onto `poseidon2.zig`) landed with the **M6 cutover, now complete**
(`docs/remediation-status.md`; §5). Everything is done: join-split **C ABI + byte layout**
(`lattica_joinsplit_verify`, round-trip tested), the **shared KATs** + Zig hash match
(`poseidon2.zig`), the **end-to-end FFI test** (`tests/ffi_integration.c`: prove→verify→tamper→
double-spend, verified), and the **constraint self-audit** (`docs/joinsplit-constraint-audit.md`).

## 8. Reproduce / verify

- `cd lattica-prover-p3 && cargo test --release` — v3-audit: 82 passed, 3 ignored.
- `cd lattica-prover-p3 && cargo test --release -- --ignored` — slower exhaustive/fuzz-style HTLC
  audit checks; v3-audit: 3 passed.
- `zig build test` and `zig build check-production` — Zig protocol suite plus production-mode compile
  gate.
- `scripts/run-real-integration.sh` — real Rust prover/verifier integration for join-split and HTLC
  lifecycle; may require running outside a filesystem sandbox so Zig can read its stdlib.
- `cd lattica-prover-p3 && cargo run --release --bin dump_p2` — regenerate Poseidon2 constants/KATs.
